    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have a professional background based in media, having previously worked in broadcast TV production in London, followed by a stint in post-Production - onboarding media to aircraft.  
      Perhaps most notably, I spent 3 and half years working on 7 series of the BAFTA winning format 'Taskmaster', progressing into a senior Researcher role.  
      I'm now looking to transform my career into something with longevity that is constantly challenging and makes the most of my experiences working as a problem solver and an integral team member.        
      Available to work immediately - I'm based in North Staffs, commutable examples are below: 
      - Manchester
      - Birmingham
      - Nottingham
      
      However, I'm also extremely happy to work remotely, with proven experience of this.
